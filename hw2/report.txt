About mydump:
-------------

- A passive network monitoring application written in C using the libpcap packet capture library.
- Captures traffic from a network interface in promiscuous mode. Promiscuous mode allows a network device to
  intercept and read each network packet that arrives.
- Reads packets from a pcap trace file.
- Prints record for each packet in its standard output.
- Supports following protocol types:
    - IPv4: TCP, UDP, ICMP
    - ARP
- Prints "OTHER" for all protocol types not mentioned above.
- Supports BPF filter for capturing a subset of the traffic.
- Supports a string pattern for capturing only packets with matching payloads.
- Supports only ETHERNET link-layer header type.

Program execution:
------------------

- Program execution begins at main() which gets command line options specified by the user
  (interface, file, BPF filter, string expression).
- If both interface and pcap filename is specified as option, program reads from the pcap file.
- Finds a default device (en0 on macOS) on which to capture if both interface and pcap filename is not specified as option.
- Opens the device/file for sniffing in promiscuous mode.
- Compiles and applies BPF filter expression specified by the user to filter traffic.
- Starts sniffing with process_packet as a callback function
- Closes capturing device or savefile
